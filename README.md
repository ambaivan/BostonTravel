Analysis of Airbnb data for Boston area

This project analyzes data to help you decide when to visit Boston and where to stay

## Motivation

The motivation for this project is to give potential visitors a comprehensive understanding of Boston’s Arbnb market. With a focus on data-driven insights, this analysis will guide those considering visiting the city by providing details on property availability and price. Whether you're planning a short trip or considering a long-term stay, this project helps to break down essential information for an informed decision.

## Libraries Used

This project utilizes a variety of Python libraries to collect, process, and analyze the data:

- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: Numerical computations and statistical analysis.
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: Data visualization.
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning for clustering and prediction tasks.
- `worldcloud`: to produce word clouds for selected neighbourhoods.

## Repository Files

- `listings.csv`: Contains the dataset of Boston's airbnb listings
- `calendar.csv`: Data on property availability and price around Boston
- `reviews.csv`: Data on customer reviews of Arbnb propertiies in Boston
- `Boston_exploration.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebooks used for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and its contents.

## Summary of Results

- Planning an Airbnb stay in Boston? Choose your neighbourhood based on what matters most — walkability, green spaces, landmarks, or nightlife. Avoid the September–October peak season if you want better availability and lower prices.
- As for cleaning fees, the data confirms what many travellers suspect: higher fees don’t mean cleaner apartments. Instead, they’re more about location and pricing strategy than actual cleaning costs.
- Bottom line — book smart and don’t assume higher prices mean a better experience.
